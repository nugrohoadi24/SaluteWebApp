                        Unless both User and Salvus Health expressly agree otherwise in writing, either of User or Salvus Health may terminate the binding effect of these Terms of Use Agreement at any time,

                        Terms of Use until all such Projects have been closed on the Site or Sites; (b) Salvus Health will continue to perform those Site Services necessary to complete any open Project or related 
                        transaction between Users; and (d) Users will continue to be obligated to pay any amounts accrued but unpaid as of the date of termination or as of the closure of any pending Service Contracts,

                        Without limiting Salvus Health’ other rights or remedies, Salvus Health may temporarily or indefinitely revoke access to the Site or Sites or Site Services, deny User’s registration, 
                        or permanently revoke User’s access to the Site and refuse to provide any or all Site Services to users if: (i) Users breach any terms and conditions of this Terms of Use, (ii) Salvus Health 
                        suspects or becomes aware that Users have provided false or misleading information to Salvus Health, or (iii) Salvus Health believes that User’s actions may cause legal liability for other Users, 
                        Salvus Health or its Affiliates, may be contrary to the interests of the Site or Sites or other Users, or may involve illicit or illegal activity. If a User’s Account is temporarily or permanently closed, 
                        such User may not use the Site under the same Account or a different Account or reregister under a new Account without Salvus Health’  prior written consent. If a User attempts to use the Site 
                        under a different Account, Salvus Health reserves the right to reclaim available funds in that Account and/or use an available Payment Method to pay for any amounts owed by a User to Salvus Health 
                        to the extent permitted by applicable law. Users acknowledge and agree that the value, reputation, and goodwill of the Site or Sites depend on transparency of User’s Account status to all Users.
                        Users therefore agree as follows: IF SALVUS HEALTH DECIDES TO TEMPORARILY OR PERMANENTLY CLOSE A USER’S ACCOUNT, SALVUS HEALTH HAS THE RIGHT, WHERE ALLOWED BY LAW, TO: (A) NOTIFY OTHER USERS THAT HAVE 
                        ENTERED INTO SERVICE CONTRACTS WITH SUCH USER TO INFORM THEM OF THE USER’S CLOSED ACCOUNT STATUS, (B) PROVIDE THOSE USERS WITH A SUMMARY OF THE REASONS FOR A USER’S ACCOUNT CLOSURE. USERS AGREE THAT 
                        SALVUS HEALTH WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO ANY NOTICE THAT IT MAY PROVIDE TO ANY USER REGARDING CLOSED ACCOUNT STATUS OR THE REASON(S) FOR THE CLOSURE.

                        Except as otherwise required by law, if a User’s Account is closed for any reason, a User will no longer have access to data, messages, files, or other materials a User keeps on the Site and that any closure of a User’s Account may involve deletion of any content stored in such User’s Account for which Salvus Health will have no liability whatsoever. Salvus Health, in its sole discretion and as permitted or required by law, may retain some or all of such User’s Account information.

                        Any dispute arising out of or in connection with these Terms of Use, including any question regarding its existence, validity or termination, shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration in Indonesia in accordance with Indonesia arbitration rules.

The fees of the arbitrator shall be borne equally by the parties, provided that the arbitrator may require that such fees be borne in such other manner as the arbitrator determines is required in order for this arbitration clause to be enforceable under applicable law.

                        After the termination of the Account of a User, the terms of these Terms of Use that expressly or by their nature contemplate performance after the binding effect of these Terms of Use terminates or expires will survive and continue in full force and effect. For example, the provisions requiring arbitration, permitting audits, protecting intellectual property, requiring non-bypass, indemnification, payment of fees, reimbursement and setting forth limitations of liability each, by their nature, contemplate performance or observance after the termination of a User Account. Without limiting any other provisions of the Terms of Use, the termination of a User Account for any reason will not release a User or Salvus Health from any obligations incurred prior to termination of a User Account or the binding effect of these Terms of Use or that thereafter may accrue in respect of any act or omission prior to such termination.

                        This Agreement, together with the other Terms of Use, sets forth the entire agreement and understanding between User and Salvus Health relating to the subject matter hereof and thereof and cancels and supersedes any prior or contemporaneous discussions, agreements, representations, warranties, and other communications between you and us, written or oral, to the extent they relate in any way to the subject matter hereof and thereof. The section headings in the Terms of Use are included for ease of reference only and have no binding effect. Even though Salvus Health drafted the Terms of Use, Users represent that they had ample time to review and decide whether to agree to the Terms of Use. If an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation of the Terms of Use arises, no presumption or burden of proof will arise favoring or disfavoring User or Salvus Health because of the authorship of any provision of the Terms of Use.

                        No modification or amendment to the Terms of Use will be binding upon Salvus Health unless in a written instrument signed by a duly authorized representative of Salvus Health or posted on the Site or Sites by Salvus Health. Salvus Health’ failure to act with respect to a breach by a User does not waive Salvus Health’ right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches. Salvus Health does not guarantee it will take action against all breaches of these Terms of Use.

                        User may not assign the Terms of Use, or any of its rights or obligations hereunder, without Salvus Health’ prior written consent in the form of a written instrument signed by a duly authorized representative of Salvus Health. Salvus Health may freely assign this Agreement and the other Terms of Use without User’s consent. Any attempted assignment or transfer in violation of this subsection will be null and void.

The illegality, invalidity, or unenforceability of such provision in that jurisdiction will not in any way affect the legality, validity, or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction or of any other provision in any jurisdiction.
